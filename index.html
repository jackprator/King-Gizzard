					<p>King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard are a prolific psych-garage band hailing from Australia. The group's beginning dates back to their time in high school together: the six-piece outfit grew up playing music with one another in small clubs around Melbourne. The group is affectionately known by fans as King Gizz. As a callback to the Grateful Dead's <i>Deadheads</i>, hardcore King Gizz fans refer to themselves as <i>Gizzheads</i>. The band's full name is loosely inspired by a nickname given to Doors' frontman Jim Morrison, <i> the Lizard King</i>. But despite a whimsical name, much of the group's work lands squarely in the hard rock category with lyrical conent centered around the peril humans have put themselves and the planet in.</p>

          <p>Much of these lyrics are credited to Stuart Mackenzie, singer and guitarist for the band. Mackenzie's songwriting is just as known for its dark content as his whoops and hollers that litter many of the band's tracks. Mackenzie's lyrics often build characters and entire worlds, but he has also been known to write from a deeply personal place. His writing from project to project may touch on universe-consuming cyborgs or the pressures of becoming a father.</p>
					<p>King Gizzard has acrewed its loyal fanbase through an inability to stay in one musical box — the band has albums in the styles of thrash metal, progressive rock and even lounge jazz — as well as a quick album cycle. The group delivered on its promise to fans in releasing five full-length projects in 2017. This combination makes King Gizz one of the most unpredictable and exciting groups in the indie music scene at present.</p>
